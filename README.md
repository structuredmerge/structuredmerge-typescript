# StructuredMerge TypeScript

TypeScript implementation of the StructuredMerge contract.

This repository is one of four peer launch implementations: [Go](https://github.com/structuredmerge/structuredmerge-go), [TypeScript](https://github.com/structuredmerge/structuredmerge-typescript), [Rust](https://github.com/structuredmerge/structuredmerge-rust), and [Ruby](https://github.com/structuredmerge/structuredmerge-ruby). The language repos are not separate products. They consume the same public spec and shared fixture corpus so tools can choose the runtime surface that fits their environment.

## Workspace

This is a pnpm workspace for StructuredMerge packages.

Initial packages:

- `@structuredmerge/tree-haver`
- `@structuredmerge/ast-merge`
- `@structuredmerge/text-merge`
- `@structuredmerge/json-merge`

## Conformance

Integration tests should consume the shared fixture corpus from the sibling `../structuredmerge-fixtures` checkout. A ruleset, fixture, diagnostic shape, or review outcome should mean the same thing whether exercised through Go, TypeScript, Rust, or Ruby.

Use the spec repository's conformance matrix for the current launch-readiness snapshot:

- <https://github.com/structuredmerge/structuredmerge-spec/blob/main/conformance-matrix.md>
- <https://github.com/structuredmerge/structuredmerge-spec/blob/main/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md>

## Development

Standard repo tasks are exposed through `mise` and native TypeScript tooling.

Common checks:

- `mise run check`
- `pnpm test`

## Status

Early implementation work. Public compatibility claims should be tied to shared fixtures and documented conformance status rather than runtime-specific assumptions.
